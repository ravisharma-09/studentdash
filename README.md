## **About the Project**

StudentDash is a simple, clean, and interactive student dashboard built to practice real-world frontend development. The project focuses on layout design, responsiveness, and basic interactivity using core web technologies.

This is a **frontend-only** project - all the data shown is static and used only for demonstration.

## **How I Used AI in This Project (For Reviewers)**

I used AI for **about 10-15%** of the work.

**Where AI helped:**

* Clarifying a small piece of JavaScript logic
* Helping debug minor layout issues in CSS
* Suggesting general UI ideas in the early stage

**What I built myself (majority of the project):**

* Writing the HTML structure
* Designing the layout
* Styling with CSS
* Organizing files and overall project flow

AI was used only as a helper, not to build the project.

## **What I Learned**

This project helped me improve:

* Structuring web pages properly
* Using Flexbox for layouts
* Writing cleaner CSS
* Basic JavaScript interactions

---

## **Future Improvements**

I plan to:

* Add a login page
* Connect to a backend
* Store real student data
* Add dark mode
